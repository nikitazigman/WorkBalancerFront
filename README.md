# WorkBalancer Front:

## About the project:

The Work Balancer Front is a front-end part of the [WorkBalancer](https://github.com/nikitazigman/WorkBalancer) WEB application.

The project was written on (React)[https://reactos.org/] using the following technologies:

- [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
- [validators](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator)

Here is a link to the design : [figma project](https://www.figma.com/file/TO9UUFGr9VGc1C7uHi4nl8/WorkBalancer?node-id=603%3A1030&t=MhDHrQfgNAVnc4RZ-0)

## Backlog:

- The app asks a user permission to use Cookies
- User can get information about his progress and history. (history page)
- Users can get metrics about their workload (Account page, dashboard)
- Users can change login and passwords
- Users get notifications and suggestions if they are out of average daily complexity.
- User can see their level (metric of sum complexity per day) in the header
- Users can add additional comments or descriptions to the task or day (Currently the idea is to use stickers like in Miro or Figma)

## ToDo:

- Define proper architecture and stack of technologies
- Rewrite using TypeScript
- Refactoring
- Allocate time to learn the React or find someone already good at it :smiley:

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
